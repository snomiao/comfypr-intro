## [0:00 – 0:07] HOOK

> "There are thousands of ComfyUI custom nodes on GitHub —
> but getting them into the official registry?
> That's a painful, manual process."

---

## [0:07 – 0:18] THE PROBLEM

> "Authors need to set up pyproject.toml,
> configure GitHub Actions, open pull requests,
> follow up on reviews — all before a single node goes live.
> Most just give up."

---

## [0:18 – 0:32] THE SOLUTION

> "Comfy-PR is an automation platform that does all of this for you.
>
> Point it at any GitHub repo —
> it forks it, configures it, creates the PR,
> and keeps following up until it's published."

---

## [0:32 – 0:47] HOW IT WORKS

> "At the core is a Slack-native AI bot.
> Ask it to publish a node — it spins up a coding agent,
> clones the repo, makes the changes, opens the PR,
> and reports back.
>
> A live dashboard tracks every node:
> open, merged, or stalled."

---

## [0:47 – 0:56] RESULTS / SCALE

> "Comfy-PR has helped process hundreds of repositories
> across the Comfy-Org ecosystem —
> turning a multi-day process into minutes."

---

## [0:56 – 1:00] CALL TO ACTION

> "Comfy-PR. Built to grow the Comfy Community."

- Pacing: ~2.5 words/second — keep delivery natural, not rushed
- Pause after "most just give up" for impact
- Line breaks above = natural breath pauses
